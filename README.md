unity3d-webplayer-jslogger
==========================

Easily integratable Javascript Logger for Unity3D Webplayer.

See a demo [here](http://derfunk.github.com/unity3d-jslogger-demo/unity3d-jslogger-demo.html).

It is threadsafe and you don't have to mess around with webfiles - all functionality comes in [__one DLL__](https://github.com/derFunk/unity3d-webplayer-jslogger/blob/master/unity3d-jslogger-project/Assets/Libs/Unity3DJavascriptLogger.dll)!

The Javascript Logger allows you to have as many named loggers as you wish. You can register the Javascript Logger with the Unity 3D Log-Callback.

If you wish to use the [Logger stand-alone, you have also new log-levels as __TRACE__ and __INFO__ available](https://github.com/derFunk/unity3d-webplayer-jslogger/blob/master/unity3d-jslogger-project/Assets/Scripts/Examples/JsLoggerCustomExample.cs).

Usage is easy: [See the code how to integrate the Javascript Logger](https://github.com/derFunk/unity3d-webplayer-jslogger/blob/master/unity3d-jslogger-project/Assets/Scripts/JsLoggerCallback.cs).

Have fun.
